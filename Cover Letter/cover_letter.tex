Insert Employer Information

To whom it may concern,

\paragraph*{}As an aspiring software engineer, I hope you will consider me for the position of Insert position here, as advertised on JobMine.

\paragraph*{}Tell why you are interested in the employer or type of work the employer does (Simply stating that you are interested does not tell why, and can sound like a form letter). Demonstrate that you know enough about the employer or position to relate your background to the employer or position. Mention specific qualifications which make you a good fit for the employerâ€™s needs. (Focus on what you can do for the employer, not what the employer can do for you.) This is an opportunity to explain in more detail relevant items in your resume. Refer to the fact that your resume is enclosed. Mention other enclosures if such are required to apply for a position.

\paragraph*{}\hspace{10pt}I believe that my skills and qualifications are a perfect match for the job and I am excited to help your company prosper to the best of my abilities. Thank you for taking the time to consider me for the position. I look forward to hearing back from you.

\vspace{12pt}Sincerely,

\vspace{12pt}Jason Fang
