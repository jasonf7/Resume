Dear Recruiter,

\paragraph*{}\hspace{10pt}I hope you will consider me for the position of "Python/jQuery Developer", as advertised on JobMine.

\paragraph*{}\hspace{10pt}I embody many of the characteristics that you look for in the ideal candidate. I have a year of experience developing web-based JavaScript BlackBerry apps for clients at a public school using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript and jQuery. In this job, I worked in a team in a fast-paced agile environment so I will already be accustomed to the life at FluidWare. I've also worked as a team lead in a robotics design which was coded in Python and the Myro Library. In addition, I often use Git as a form of version control.

\paragraph*{}\hspace{10pt}All my side projects can be found in my GitHub repository under https://github.com/jasonf7 for reference. Attached to the cover letter you will find my resume which showcases my skills and talents of which I will bring to make your company strong and powerful!

\paragraph*{}\hspace{10pt}Thank you for taking the time to consider me for the position. I look forward to hearing back from you.
